## Key Concepts

- **Context Engineering**: Optimizing what information is available in the context window
- **Memory Persistence**: Saving and loading memories across sessions
- **Importance Detection**: Distinguishing signal from noise
- **Store Interoperability**: Converting between different memory backends
- **Progressive Loading**: Loading context on-demand based on relevance
