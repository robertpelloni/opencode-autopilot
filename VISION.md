# Vision: The AI Council

## The Problem
Single-model code generation is fragile. LLMs hallucinate, miss context, and struggle with complex architectural reasoning. Developers spend more time verifying AI code than writing it.

## The Solution: Orchestration via Debate
`opencode-autopilot-council` introduces a **Multi-Model Consensus Engine**. Instead of trusting one model, we convene a "Council" of specialized Supervisors (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro) to:

1. **Debate**: Models critique each other's proposed solutions.
2. **Refine**: Iterative rounds of improvement based on cross-model feedback.
3. **Decide**: A consensus mechanism acts as the final arbiter, selecting the most robust solution.

## Core Pillars
- **No Single Point of Failure**: If one model hallucinates, others catch it.
- **Specialization**: Leverage Claude for architecture, GPT-4 for logic, and Gemini for creative problem solving.
- **Transparency**: The debate process is visible, providing "reasoning trace" for the final code.

## Future Roadmap
- ~~**Dynamic Supervisor Selection**: Automatically pick the best team for the task (e.g., "Security Audit" team vs. "UI Design" team).~~ ✅ Implemented
- ~~**Human-in-the-Loop Veto**: Interactive mode where the developer acts as the Council Chair.~~ ✅ Implemented
- ~~**Plugin Ecosystem**: Standardized interface for adding new models/supervisors.~~ ✅ Implemented

### Next Generation Features
- ~~**Multi-Workspace Support**: Manage debates across multiple projects simultaneously~~ ✅ Implemented
- ~~**Debate Templates**: Pre-configured debate structures for common scenarios (code review, security audit, architecture review)~~ ✅ Implemented
- ~~**Model Fine-Tuning Integration**: Support for custom fine-tuned models as supervisors~~ ✅ Implemented
- ~~**Collaborative Debates**: Multiple human participants in the council~~ ✅ Implemented
- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Visual insights into debate patterns and supervisor performance trends
