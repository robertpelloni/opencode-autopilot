REASONING: As a mock supervisor, I've reviewed the proposed changes and found them to be well-structured and following best practices. The implementation appears solid and ready for integration.`;

I've analyzed the development task and here are my observations:

1. **Code Quality**: The proposed changes appear to follow standard coding conventions.

2. **Potential Issues**: No critical issues identified in this mock review.

3. **Suggestions**: 
   - Consider adding unit tests for new functionality
   - Ensure error handling is comprehensive

4. **Overall Assessment**: The task looks reasonable and well-scoped.

This is a simulated response for testing purposes.`;
    }

    return `**${this.name} Response**

I've reviewed the provided context and have the following thoughts:

The approach seems reasonable. Key considerations:
- Implementation follows common patterns
- No obvious security concerns
- Performance should be acceptable

This is a mock response for testing without API keys.`;
